1. FINANCE

a. The stock-to-flow model is a market model that measures value of a commodity relative to it's current and new supply. The BTC SF model states that value of bitcoin is and will be defined by it's scarcity and regulated/fixed supply. It compares it's model to similar models of scarce commodities such as Gold and Silver relative to the USD. SF is calculated by dividing the current stock of the commodity by new annual supply/production. The current SF for Gold, Silver and Bitcoin are 62, 22 and 25 and market cap of $8.5T, $400B and $118B USD respectively. However it further suggests that unlike Gold and Silver which have an almost fixed supply, the SF and market value of bitcoin will continue to double after every "halving". 
Halving is an event in the Crypto's lifecycle whereby the reward for mining (a process in which miners verify transactions in the block chain by solving complex cryptographical hashes) is halved. The current reward for mining after the May 2020 halvings is 12.5 new bitcoins from a previous 25. The halving cycle is after every 210,000 blocks and with every block being verified averagely in 10 minutes it's estimated to happen every 4 years.
